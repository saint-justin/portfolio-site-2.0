# Portfolio Site 2.0
The second version of my portfolio website, see the active version at https://jvaughn.org/

## Why nano-react-app?
The shorthand answer is that I've read up on create-react-app being bloated, plus it uses a bunch of extra information that I neither need nor will use within the scope of this project. There's a pretty neat medium article on all that [here for those who are interested](https://hackernoon.com/create-react-app-is-way-too-bloated-5db07c3511).

## How'd you design this?
Hop into the portfolio-site folder, then the dev_assets folder, then feel free to check out all the sketch files in there. The first two are corrupted, so start with portfolio-site-03 and move from there.
