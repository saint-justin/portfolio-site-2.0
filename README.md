# Portfolio Site 2.0
The second version of my portfolio website, see the active version at https://jvaughn.org/

## Where did the design come from?
I made it from scratch! Hop into the portfolio-site folder, then the dev_assets folder, then feel free to check out all the sketch files in there. The first two are corrupted, so start with portfolio-site-03 and move from there-- That will show off the entire process I used to get to where the site is now. If you're only interested in seeing the final sketch file, just click on the last file in that folder with the highest number and open it up. 

## Why are there two folders in here?
The first and second attempts and building this site are the two folders. The final build and the active version of the site only contain the information from _portoflio-redux_.

## How long did taking this make?
From design to where it is now, I'm sitting at ~40 hours of work total. That said, that number is a bit skewed because I've been working on this as a side project on and off for around two months.

## Why did you make _(insert choice here)_ choice?
Shoot me an email over in the contact portion of my website https://jvaughn.org/ and I'll be happy to let you know!
